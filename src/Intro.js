        <h4 className="intro-description">Hi my name is Kyle and I'm a part-time Frontend Engineer at the startup SunnySide, and an incoming Software Engineer intern at Siemens EDA. I'm a computer science student that has a love for design, so I'm always refining my craft to make the cleanest possible UIs for websites and apps. And something unique about me is I was raised on a teeny tiny island in the Caribbean called Trinidad and Tobago. So I am able to use my unique perspective and life experiences to help contribute creative and thought provoking ideas into the workplace!</h4>
